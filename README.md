# Mixins

A web app to help you choose and make a drink for you or your friends, define the intensity of flavours you like in a drink and choose a drink to see how to make it. Tweak a drinks flavour by moving their position on the chart.

One of the aims of this project is to create an interface based on principles described by Bret Victor. Bret has a core principal governing his work, creators need an immediate connection to what they create. This program will display for users a group of drinks within a flavour profile they have defined. Once the user has picked a drink they can begin to change it to better suit their taste. The user has a variety of options when it comes to changing the contents of the drink, for example click and drag a particular ingredient to increase/decrease its quantity in the glass. As the user manipulates the number, the representation of the glass and it's contents will chage accordingly, the position of the drink on the flavour chart will also move. This allwos a user to immediately see how their changes to the drink will affect its taste.
